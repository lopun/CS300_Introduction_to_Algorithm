Programming Assignment # 0
Fibonacci number is a sequence of natural numbers such that

You are required to implement and test the three different methods of computing Fibonacci number:

Recursive algorithm (FibRec)
Iterative algorithm (FibIter)
Repeated squaring algorithm (FibRepSq)
Given an integer n, compute the nth Fibonacci number modulo 30011. The number 30011 is stored in the variable PRIME.

Experiment
Once you have implemented the functions correctly, you are required to perform an experiment:

Compute FibRec(n), FibIter(n), and FibRepSq(n) on different values of n and measure the runtime of each trial. Determine the largest n for which each function can print its output within 30 seconds. For example, if FibRec(100) takes 20 seconds and FibRec(101) takes 40 seconds, record 100 for the function FibRec.

The largest input n falls into one of:

[0, 100]
[101, 10000]
[10001, 1000000]
[1000001, 1000000000]
[1000000001, 2147483647]
Store the index (hardcode) of the range you achieved in the variables MAX_OF_INPUT_REC, MAX_OF_INPUT_ITER, and MAX_OF_INPUT_REPSQ.

There is an execution time limit of 1 minute.aree(data);
